### Escaping Special Characters in JSX

#### Issue:
When using certain characters like single quotes (`'`) or backticks (`` ` ``) inside JSX, React enforces escaping these characters to prevent issues with HTML rendering. This can cause errors such as:

```bash
Error: `'` can be escaped with `&apos;`, `&lsquo;`, `&#39;`, `&rsquo;`.  react/no-unescaped-entities
```

#### Cause:
JSX treats characters like `"` and `'` as part of HTML syntax. Therefore, they must be escaped to prevent breaking the structure of the HTML or JSX.

#### Solution:
Use HTML entities to escape characters in JSX. Here are some commonly used escapes:

- **Single quote (`'`)**: Use `&apos;` or `&#39;`
- **Left single quote (`‘`)**: Use `&lsquo;`
- **Right single quote (`’`)**: Use `&rsquo;`
- **Double quotes (`"`)**: Use `&quot;`
- **Ampersand (`&`)**: Use `&amp;`

#### Example:

If you have this code in JSX:

```jsx
<p>Hello, I'm a Web Developer.</p>
```

It should be updated to:

```jsx
<p>Hello, I&apos;m a Web Developer.</p>
```

This ensures compatibility with JSX rendering and prevents build-time or deployment errors.

#### How to Fix:

1. Identify where unescaped entities are used, especially within JSX blocks.
2. Replace these characters with the appropriate HTML entities as shown above.
3. Test the component to ensure it compiles without errors.
